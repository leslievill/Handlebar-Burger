# Handlebar-Burger
 This burger logger is made with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM. It lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat and whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page.


Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour it!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
